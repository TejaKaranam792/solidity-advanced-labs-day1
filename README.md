⚡ Solidity Essentials – Quick Reference

A compact repo covering four powerful Solidity concepts with clean examples:

🔹 Function Overloading

Understanding how Solidity allows multiple functions with the same name but different parameters.

🔹 Fallback & Receive

How contracts react when Ether is sent — with or without data.

🔹 call vs delegatecall vs staticcall

Clear examples showing who executes the code, whose storage changes, and when state changes are allowed.

🔹 ABI Encoding / Decoding

Practical use of abi.encode, abi.encodePacked, hashing, and handling data.
